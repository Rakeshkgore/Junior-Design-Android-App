<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Currently our client, Dr. Walter Evans, from Hearatale has a website that has interactive literacy study materials. 
But due to the limitation of 2nd grade students’ access to laptops, desktops or consistent internet access a mobile application, 
with offline capabilities, is needed. Our solution is an android application, developed using Java in Android Studio. 
This app will mirror the Hearatale’s education website for 2nd grade students, in order to make mixed use of both platforms seamless. 

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Java](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

<!-- Features -->
## Features
### Attractive Design

* Our app targets 2nd grade students who want to learn literature through their phone or tablet. As a result, our design is cartoony to attract children’s attention. Users will interact with different animals when they click on different buttons. 

### Quizzes and Rewards

* Users can take quizzes whenever they feel confident with the current topic. Every time they answer a quiz question correctly with one try, they will get two coins and two puzzle pieces. If they answer the question correctly with two tries, they will get one coin and one puzzle piece. Finish collecting all the puzzle pieces means the user has mastered the topic. These features could attract users to spend more time in the app to get achievements. 

### Sound 

* Since our app is a literacy app, it is very important for users to understand the pronunciation of the words they learn. Each lesson and quiz contain sound for each word to give users a better learning experience. 

### Offline Access

* One of the major goals of building this app is to help students who don’t have access to laptop or desktop and don’t have Internet access. As a result, our app is built in a way 	that it could be used without Internet access. Currently, the results can be stored locally if the phone or tablet is not connected to the Internet.  



<!-- Release Notes -->
## Release Notes
### Bugs/Defects
* Implemented sound does not stop when the user leaves the current page. In the case the other page user visits has sound too, then both sets of sounds
will continue playing simultaneously 
* Missing sounds and puzzle pieces (unable to obtain from client)
